In our tauri app let's plan and create a document for first module.
Create a new screen/page/route for module if one does not exist.
We will use the dub document to keep track of our progress.
also for any reason don't create/write a new document for summarizing or whatever.
Do not write any timeframe or deadlines in the document.
Keep it simple and straight to the point.
